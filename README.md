## Genotyping in an HPC environment
# Preamble
This repo is for testing out some genotyping tools on the gpsc. 

Also some misc. links that cover tools used that I have found helpful:

GATK [parallelism and multithreading](https://sites.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/legacy-gatk-documentation/dictionary/1988-Parallelism?pli=1)

GATK [best practices in practice](https://hpc.nih.gov/training/gatk_tutorial/)
